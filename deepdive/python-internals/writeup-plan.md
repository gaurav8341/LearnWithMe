# what should be the structure
- Introduction
- Overview python flow
1. java - python similarities and differences
2. python steps to interpretation
    1. parser
        lexer
        tokenizer
        parser
    2. Compiler
        control flow
        assembler
    3. Interpreter
        Line by line go through each bytecode instruction
3. What is bytecode/opcode instruction?
    what is opcode
    one example
    documentation links
3. Parser internals
    grammer 
    pgen
    what lexer does and how
    what tokenizer does and how
    what parser does and how
4. bytecode Compiler internals
    what is ast?
    ast to instruction
5. Interpreter internals -- how this is different from JVM.
6. New JIT -- what will change


- Intro
    - python interpreted lang
    - machine independant
    - python implememtaions we only focus on cpython

- Simple flow 
    - How python code runs
    - bytecode
    - Similarity and diff with JAva
    **NOTE: Here will explain parser, compiler interpreter in brief not more than 5 lines for each but not any details**
    - Bytecode 
        - what is opcode
        - how to generate bytecode
        - some examples

- Flow
    - Theory How python runs
        - parser
            - lexer
            - tokenizer
            - parser
            - grammer 
            - pgen
        - Compiler
            - control flow
            - assembler
        - Interpreter
        
        **NOTE: Here we will explain how things happen. we will also give actual cod that run with function name but wont go deeper than that**

    - what happens when `python yesy.py` is run
