- Introduction
- Overview python flow
1. java - python similarities and differences
2. python steps to interpretation
    1. parser
        lexer
        tokenizer
        parser
    2. Compiler
        control flow
        assembler
    3. Interpreter
        Line by line go through each bytecode instruction
3. What is bytecode/opcode instruction?
    what is opcode
    one example
    documentation links
3. Parser internals
    grammer 
    pgen
    what lexer does and how
    what tokenizer does and how
    what parser does and how
4. bytecode Compiler internals
    what is ast?
    ast to instruction
5. Interpreter internals -- how this is different from JVM.
6. New JIT -- what will change
