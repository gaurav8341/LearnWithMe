# Trie (pronouned try)

A Tree like data structure in which every node is suffix value and every branch has its own value attched to it. The Suffix value is nothing but collective value of all the branches travelled to get to that node. 

()---a--->(a)----b--->(ab)----

Unlike above example there can be multiple branches after each node
